# Snake (HTML)

A small Snake game that runs fully offline in your browser.

## Run
- Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari).
- Controls:
  - Arrow keys or WASD to move
  - Space to pause/resume
  - R to restart

## Share
- Zip the folder and share it, or host the three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) on any static site host.
- The **Share** button copies a short message with your current score to your clipboard.

Enjoy!

## Host on GitHub Pages (free)
1. Create a new repo on GitHub (e.g. `snake-game`).
2. Upload these files to the repo root:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `README.md`
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, choose:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` (or `master`) and `/ (root)`
5. Save. GitHub will show your site URL (it may take a minute).

Tip: If you rename the repo, the URL changes.
